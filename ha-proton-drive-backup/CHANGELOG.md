## v0.1.1 [2026-07-04]

- Fixed getting stuck "signed out" (with backups paused) after an internet
  outage: offline CLI errors were misread as a sign-out and never re-checked.
  Every sync now re-probes a signed-out session, so the add-on recovers on
  its own once connectivity returns.
- Added a Sign out button (About page) — previously the only way to switch
  accounts was wiping the add-on's data.
- Fixed the three-dots menu on ignored backups being rendered semi-transparent.

## v0.1.0 [2026-07-01]

Initial release of the Proton Drive port.

- Forked from [hassio-google-drive-backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup)
  (MIT, © Stephen Beechen), replacing the Google Drive backend with a Proton
  Drive backend that drives the official `proton-drive` CLI.
